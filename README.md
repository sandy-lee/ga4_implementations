# Google Analytics 4 Implementations

## ðŸ’¬ About:
- This repo contains a collection of documents I've written to standardise migrations from UA -> GA4 migrations and new implementations.

## ðŸ’¾ Files in this repo are:
- **tracking_framework_best_practice.xlxs** - this is a collection of best practice settings intended for a new GA4 property to ensure everything is tracked and all data is collected as part of a checklist approach. It was intended to be used by analytics freelancers and junior team members as a guide for expected standards when implementing a GA4 setup.
-  **tracking_specification_generic.xlxs** - this document outlines all events, custom dimensions, conversions and set up information for a GA4 implementation and is intended to be used as a record of all actions taken when implementing a measurement solution.
-  **visual_tracking_specification.pdf** - this document visually outlines all tracking events as well as all parameters that are passed with example values. It serves as companion to the tracking specification document.
-  
## âš¡ Next Steps:
- These documents are out of date now as they were written in summer of 2023. They will need to be updated to reflect updated best practice.
